# Git Bash Guide

This repository is used as an example for the [Git Bash Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wT0Yg-izcKcWoY160OMla-0IAe7orteuTCjk2A1HviY/edit?usp=sharing) created in 2022. In a README, it is typically good to write down a short description of what the project is.

## Ignored Folders
For Unity projects, a good practice is to have a section of links to the download of ignored assets. Some plugins and packages are very large, and better hosted as a separate ZIP file that will need to be downloaded separately from the cloned repository.
